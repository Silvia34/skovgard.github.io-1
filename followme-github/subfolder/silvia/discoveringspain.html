                    <p>Okay, so let’s talk about the beautiful Spain!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It has attractive and famous cities such as Madrid (the capital) and Barcelona, those two are the most well-known, also Seville in the south and Bilbao in the north.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Spain is divided into 17 autonomous communities which are Andalusia, Community of Madrid, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha, Galicia, Basque Country, Valencian Community, Castile and Leon, Asturias, La Rioja, Region of Murcia, Cantabria, Canary Islands, Navarre, Extremadura, Aragon, and Balearic Islands. </p>

                    <h3 id="2">How’s the weather like in Spain?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <div class="partners">
                        <div class="column">
                            <img src="images/spain_beach.jpg" alt="Beach in Spain">
                        </div>
                        <div class="column">
                            <p>For those who love hot summers it’s the perfect place to visit, actually the southern part of Spain is the warmest.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                 
                    <br>
                    <p>The weather in Spain changes depending on where you are. In the north there is more rain and cold days than in the south and southeast. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So, if you’re planning on visiting Spain and you like hot summers, going to the beach and getting tanned go near the coast or to the south, you’ll experience a really warm Spanish welcome!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But if you like more normal temperature visit the inner part of Spain or the north. Actually, a good time to visit this part of Spain is Spring in the months of April/May but also September/October just after the summer (also there are less tourists).</p>

                    <p>Around Spain you also will find the famous “paella”, which is basically rice and other stuff, but it tastes so forking good.
